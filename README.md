## III. Jacobian Matrix of SCARA Mechanical Manipulator description and computation.
### The Jacobian matrix is a fundamental notion in mathematics, particularly multivariable calculus. Its purpose is to depict the rate at which one set of variables changes in relation to another.

### The concept of the Jacobian Matrix was first introduced by the mathematician ***Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi*** in the 19th century.
